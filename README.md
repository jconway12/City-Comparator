# javascript-project

## Architecture & Technologies
Project is built with:

JavaScript for data visualization and management,
D3 and CSS for interactive visualization, and 
Webpack to bundle javascript files.

## Overview

There are many ways one could measure the quality of a location, either through economic, environmental, or social factors. The Teleport API offers data collected from a variety of resources on 16 aspects of urban life that contribute to a positive experience. These aspects are ranked on a scale of 1 - 10, with 10 being the most desireable. This project aims to dynamically vizualize these information.

## Functionality & MVP 

Users are able to:

 See graph of all countries and their rating breakdowns
 Toggle visible ratings to compare importance
 Create minimum values per category to filter locations
 Search specific locations 
 
In addition, this project contains:

 An informational page describing methodology with links to raw data
 A production README

## Data & APIs
Data comes from the Teleport API 
  
## Wireframe
The visualization consists of a main page with a large bar chart, with each city bar being broken down into components representing ratings for each category.

## Design
Colors correlate to city attribute, while size of the bar relates to relative score out of 10.
