UPDATE IDEA: 
have - array with place name and ranking 
- look up stats by city 
- toggle categories to find cities (slider to see cities w/in range?)
brainstorm: how to visualize stats
BONUS - get lat/lng for map purpose 
BONUS - get air quality data

OLD:
Main page: 
- map with air quality visualization, continuous by coordinates
- search bar/ list of cities to see air quality/ quality of life data
- toggle for categories?

City page: 
- vizualization on quality of life
- vizualization on air quality 
- toggle for categories?
